## Hi there üëã I'm Jorge Andr√©s!

My passion for computation and informatics spans a lifetime, ignited at just 7 years old with MS-DOS and Windows 3.1. This early fascination led to my first job in computer repair, building a foundation for solving technical challenges.

After 14 years as a Telecom Engineer, I'm now channeling my analytical expertise and dedication into becoming a Junior Python Developer. I recently reinforced my skills by successfully completing Code in Place 2025, and I'm eager to build impactful, scalable applications.

üöÄ My Current Focus & Aspirations:

I'm actively deep-diving into web development with Django, focusing on robust backend systems and crafting engaging user interfaces. My immediate goal is to complete a series of 30-day small projects, simulating junior developer experiences to rapidly expand my practical Python skills.

### Looking ahead, I'm excited by the prospect of:

Building scalable applications such as advanced search engines and efficient web scrapers.

Transitioning into Machine Learning once I solidify my core coding experience.

Developing large-scale, daily-use applications, envisioning something as impactful as a wallet app within the next two years.

Actively contributing to open-source projects.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies I'm Learning / Using:

**Languages:** Python (my primary focus)

**Web Frameworks:** Django

**Frontend Basics:** HTML, CSS (essential for a holistic understanding, though backend remains my core)

**Databases:** SQLite, SQL

**Version Control:** Git (currently using v2.5), GitHub

**Tools:** VS Code (actively learning)

‚ú® My Current Projects:

**MarketHub Loja_test:** A mini e-commerce platform built with Django. This hands-on project is central to applying and expanding my skills in user management, product handling, and practical web architecture.

**Football Player Search Engine (In Progress/Aspiration):** Born from my Code in Place 2025 project, this mini search engine for players in basic Python is my next scalability challenge. I aim to integrate libraries like Pandas, build a web interface with a database, and explore APIs for auto-updating player statistics throughout the season.

üå± What's Next:

My intermediate roadmap involves mastering common Python and SQL libraries, exploring foundational Java concepts, and further strengthening my HTML/CSS knowledge to complement my backend specialization. Machine Learning remains my long-term goal. I'm excited to continuously develop projects like the football player engine as I learn and grow.
